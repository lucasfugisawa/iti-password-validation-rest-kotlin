# @itidigital Backend Challenge: Password Validation API - Kotlin Implementation

- #### This project is the Kotlin version of the Java implementation that can be found at https://github.com/lucasfugisawa/iti-password-validation-rest-kotlin
- #### Automated tests are available in the Java implementation, but still pending in this Kotlin implementation.

This is a possible solution to the backend challenge found at: https://github.com/itidigital/backend-challenge

Since I solved the challenge for fun (I didn't apply for the related opportunities), there might be gaps in the implementation of the requirements.

If you have any questions, inquiries, suggestions, critiques, etc., feel free to get in touch with me.
